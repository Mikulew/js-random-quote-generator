## General info

>People have been using the noun quote as a truncation of quotation for over one hundred years, and its use in less formal contexts is widespread today. **Quote** is a repeat or copy out (words from a text or speech written or spoken by another person).

Some people need motivational quotes to motivate themselves to do something. If I have a crisis in IT and I don't feel like programming - all I have to do is see the demo to change it.

P.S. I know the word *random* is only in the name. The quotes iterate sequentially in the file `quotes.js`, but for someone who sees the demo for the first time, the following quotes will be a nice surprise.


## Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Font Awesome 5)
* JavaScript (ES6+)
